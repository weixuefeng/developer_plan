<h1>Newton Developer Outreach Plan: Let's Unscrew the World!</h1>

Newton is proud to release its developer outreach plan and global grand challenge. For too long, humanity has been screwing up planet Earth - and the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">United Nation's Sustainability Development Goals</a> aim to fix some of that. At Newton, we want to see how we can apply blockchain and other technologies to helping things along.

That's where you, <strong>the developers</strong>, come in. We want your feedback to see which goals we can best address, the best infrastructure to submit and vote on ideas, and your proposals for how to make the the world a little less screwed up.

Right now, we've got our <a href="http://github.com/newtonproject/developer-plan/">developer plan on GitHub</a> - we want your feedback and commits on how we can make it better.

We're also looking for community members to help with infrastructure support - we need to choose and deploy a platform to ensure the community has a voice in how we fix the planet.
